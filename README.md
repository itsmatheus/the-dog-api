# The Dog API
As my first practical project in the Software Engineering class, I created a website that fetches data from [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) and organizes the breeds into breed groups.
Once a breed group is selected, all of the breeds inside said category will be displayed as clickable cards, which display additional information of each individual breed when clicked.

(The project has been condensed into a single .html file due to university's requirements.)
